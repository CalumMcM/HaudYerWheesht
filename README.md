## About

Originally HaudYerWheesht was started to record the number of sirens/loud noises that passed through the very busy junction, Tollcross in Edinburgh, Scotland. However, once I found myself in possession of an Enviro+ the project quickly developed into much more than siren counting.

Now with the capability of recording gases, temperature, humidity and much more I plan on applying machine learning to the NH3 and NO2 values to predict what future values will be given the time of day.

This project is still on going however and no results have yet been published. 

The live values that the enviro+ is recording **can** however be monitered on the following link:
